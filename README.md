  ## Usage
  
  Planted requires you to be logged in to start editing your own garden. We have prepared a sample account if you just want to see how the application works without signing up. The sample accounts email to log in is "lernantino@gmail.com" and the password is "password12345". Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to the "My Garden" page. There you can starting creating or editing your gardens layout. To add a specific plant to your garden start typing the plant's name in the search box and there will be a list of available plants shown. Click on the desired plant and then click the the button to add the plant to the list. Once the plant is on your list there will be a dropdown button where you can select what color you want to represent the plant. When the color is selected, it is saved with the plant name. If you start planning your garden but want to change the color of the plant midway, you'll have to remark on the grid with the new color. If you want to add more plants just follow these steps again with a new plant.
